# AsciiDoc Preview package

Shows the rendered HTML of the AsciiDoc content in the current editor.

You can install this module from the command-line by typing `apm install asciidoc-preview`.
You can toggle the preview pane, which appears to the right of the editor, using the key combination `ctrl-shift-a`.
More options are accessible by right-clicking on the preview.

Thanks to @kevinsawicki! I just adapted [markdown-preview](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview) and used [asciidoctorjs-npm-wrapper](https://github.com/anthonny/asciidoctorjs-npm-wrapper).
