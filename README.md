### :information_source: **Information** :information_source:

[GitHub is sunsetting Atom on December 15, 2022](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/).   
As a result, we recommend migrating to an alternative solution. The Asciidoctor community is now focusing on providing the best writing experience using the [IntelliJ platform](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin) or [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-vscode).

On December 15, 2022, this repository will be archived.

## Disclaimer About Styles

The preview window is not meant to emulate the published styles.
Rather, it's intended to present a preview of the content to assist with editing.
This is by design.
It also aims to make the best use of limited screen space.
So, for example, you won't see functionality such as a sidebar TOC.
The colors may also differ to better integrate with the Atom theme.
If you want to customize the apparance of the preview, you can specify your own stylesheet in the settings.
